I'm glad you are here. I plan to talk about learning to code at 60 years old, and, hopefully, find some help along the way from people who've been in my position before.

I live on my Android device, so thought I would learn Kotlin, but now I've come to think I should learn Java first, as there are many more resources for the beginner on Java,
